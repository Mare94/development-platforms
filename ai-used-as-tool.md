# AI used as a tool

## Articial ingelligence and its uses

In this age, using AI to help create codes snippets is becoming more normal as they become more capable.
with the creation of AI's like chatGPT and others we can see a drastic change in how many approach the creating of apps or web sites.
There is an endless amount of possibilites from already established programmers to people just learning about it using AI to help them create apps.

but an important part of this is not to only rely on the AI knowing how to make a fully finished project, humans still need to check over and control what has been made and implement it correctly. another aspect is that AI is meant to supplement our creation, and not replace us int it, the use of AI as a tool is meant to speed up the writing process of coding/programming. an underlying issue that might occur with the use of AI is that it will be the sole writer of a project without much control by a human, this is where a beginner might fall and assume that the AI knows and is able to write perfect code.

## AI used as a tool

When using working on a project, and you run into an error or a problem thats hard to solve. this is when using AI might be of a big help to you. you can either prompt what see into an IA like chatGPT or have a built-in AI help you figure out what the issue is, this is where we see the most use of AI as a tool. you can also take advantage of AI for when you're writing easy code snippets or a function you'll reuse. you can have it write the array or other functions that is often used.

## Misuse of AI

With how common and widespread AI is becoming, it is important to not misuse the powers you wield with it. a common factor where AI is in the danger of misuse, is the data it has been trained with, its decision making might be biased, the information can be outdated or an employer might look to replace their workers relying only on AI among other things.
Another big concern with the use of AI is security risks, lack of transparency, privacy and probably the biggest of them all dependence on AI itself.
